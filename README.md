In this work we seek to support small business owners and independent sellers who do not have the resources to aesthetically market their products. We lessen this barrier for our target users by training the Stable Diffusion [1] image generation model on just a few images of a product provided by the user; once the model is trained on the images, the user can input text to refer to a trained image and specify a new environment for the item in the trained pictures such that a new picture is rendered by the model. Our method is unique in that it focuses on preserving the nature of the item before textual input from the user by first training the model on multiple images of the same object.
